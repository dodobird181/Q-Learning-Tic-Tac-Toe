# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python, which uses reinforcement-learning to create a singleplayer AI policy. I made the GUI using PyGame and integrated the reinforcement-learning singleplayer code following [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-implement-tictactoe-189582bea542).

If you have a Windows computer, you can run a '.exe' build of my game by downloading and unzipping [this file](https://github.com/dodobird181/Tic-Tac-Toe/tree/main/build), which was generated using the Python module [cx_freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This mini-project was created during July 2020.
