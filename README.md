# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python, which uses reinforcement-learning to create a singleplayer AI policy. I made the GUI using PyGame and integrated the reinforcement-learning singleplayer code following [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-implement-tictactoe-189582bea542).
