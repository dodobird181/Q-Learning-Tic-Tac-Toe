# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe in Python, which uses a primitive form of reinforcement-learning, called Q-Learning, to create a singleplayer AI policy. The GUI was made using PyGame, and the Q-Learning was implemented following a description in [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-implement-tictactoe-189582bea542).

If you have a Windows computer, you can run a 'main.exe' build of my game by downloading and unzipping [this file](https://github.com/dodobird181/Tic-Tac-Toe/raw/main/build/TicTacToe.zip) (generated using the Python module [cx_freeze](https://cx-freeze.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

This mini-project was created during July 2020 by Sam Morris.
